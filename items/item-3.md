# Description

As a user I want to be able to generate 3 different occupancy percentages (25/50/100)<br />
So that I can map out optimized seating plans

## Acceptance criteria

### 1.
---
Given a basic plan (rows/columns) has been created<br />
when the user chooses a percentage (25/50/100) from the menu<br />
then the final plan (rows/columns/available seats) is generated.

### 2.
---
Given a basic plan has been created<br />
when the user enters an invalid input<br />
then the system asks for a valid input.

### 3.
---
Given the user has created the room<br />
when the user wants to change the occupancy rate<br />
then the user is denied and asked to create a new plan.
