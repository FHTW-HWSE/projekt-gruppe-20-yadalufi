# Description

As a user<br />
I want to be able to generate different occupancy percentages.<br />
So that I can see how many students fit in the room at the specific occupancy percentage.

## Acceptance criteria

### 1.
---
Given that the user has defined the room size and layout<br />
when the user selects a specific occupancy percentage from a dropdown menu<br />
then the system tells the number of students that can fit in the room using that occupancy percentage.

### 2.
---
Given that the user has generated a room with specific occupancy percentage<br />
when the user wants a different occupancy percentage from the dropdown menu<br />
then the system offers the option to restart creation of the room.
